  abstract = {Many students of statistics and econometrics express frustration with the way a problem known as “bad control” is treated in the traditional literature. The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is intended to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

	abstract = {Understanding causality is crucial for social scientific research to develop strong theories and inform practice. However, explicit discussion of causality is often lacking in social science literature due to ambiguous causal language. This paper introduces a text mining model fine-tuned to extract causal sentences from full-text social science papers. A dataset of 529 causal and 529 non-causal sentences manually annotated from the Cooperation Databank (CoDa) was curated to train and evaluate the model. Several pre-trained language models (BERT, SciBERT, RoBERTa, LLAMA, and Mistral) were fine-tuned on this dataset and general-purpose causality datasets. Model performance was evaluated on held-out social science and general-purpose test sets. Results showed that fine-tuning transformer models on the social science dataset significantly improved causal sentence extraction, even with limited data, compared to the models fine-tuned only on the general-purpose data. Results indicate the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning and data for accurately capturing causal language in academic writing. This automated causal sentence extraction method enables comprehensive, large-scale analysis of causal claims across the social sciences. By systematically cataloging existing causal statements, this work lays the foundation for further research to uncover the mechanisms underlying social phenomena, inform theory development, and strengthen the methodological rigor of the field.},

  abstract = {The primary aim of this paper is to show how graphical models can be used as a mathematical language for integrating statistical and subject-matter information. In particular, the paper develops a principled, nonparametric framework for causal inference, in which diagrams are queried to determine if the assumptions available are sufficient for identifying causal effects from nonexperimental data. If so the diagrams can be queried to produce mathematical expressions for causal effects in terms of observed distributions; otherwise, the diagrams can be queried to suggest additional observations or auxiliary experiments from which the desired inferences can be obtained.}

  abstract = {Computational reproducibility is the ability to obtain identical results from the same data with the same computer code. It is a building block for transparent and cumulative science because it enables the originator and other researchers, on other computers and later in time, to reproduce and thus understand how results came about, while avoiding a variety of errors that may lead to erroneous reporting of statistical and computational results. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, PAC). PAC eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages. Making technical advancements that serve reproducibility more widely accessible for researchers holds the potential to innovate the research process and to help it become more productive, credible, and reliable.},
