A README file will often be the first point of contact for users of any project, including FAIR theories.
It should contain all information people need to get started with using your FAIR theory.
A README is a basic form of documentation with directions on how to use a FAIR theory.
It serves as a guide for others to understand, evaluate, and build upon your work.
A comprehensive and clear README file is essential for making your FAIR theory accessible and reusable. 

Below, we outline the key sections to include in a README file for a FAIR theory:

## 1. Title

Provide a clear title for your theory.
We recommend prefacing the title with the words `FAIR theory:`, just like a systematic review should have the words `systematic review` in the title, to help sentient readers immediately identify it as such.

## 2. Description

Provide a plain-text description of the theory and its scope.
This could be a one- to two-sentence summary of what the theory explains or predicts,
and the context or field of study where the theory applies.

## 3. Interoperability

Most README files contain a section labeled "Getting Started", "Instructions for Use", or "How to Use".
From a FAIR perspective, such a section might be better labeled "Interoperability".
We propose using this section to explicitly address the theory's X-interoperability,
telling users exactly what they can use the theory for, and how. 

> **X-interoperability:** Tells you what you can do with a theory, and how.


## 4. Contributing

Pertaining to the Reusability criterion of the FAIR principles, this section should tell users the *social expectations regarding reuse and contributions*.

## 5. License

The legal complement to the preceding *Contributing* section, this section should refer readers to the LICENSE file to learn about the *legal conditions of reuse*.

## 6. Citing this Work

Tell users how to cite the theory. Note that this section is redundant with the Zenodo archive, which has a preferred citation field. The disadvantage of redundant information is that you may have to maintain this section of the README going forward. The advantage is that documenting related works in the README makes it more readily accessible to users. We suggest a compromise: retain this section, but use it to direct the reader to the preferred citation on the Zenodo page.

## 7. Related Works

This section should refer to the work that the FAIR theory is derived from, or documented in. Again, this is redundant with metadata entered in Zenodo. We nevertheless recommend using this section to direct the reader to Zenodo, and optionally, to document one canonical reference for the theory that is unlikely to change going forward.



# Example: The Empirical Cycle

Below, we break down the README file of our implementation of De Groot's empirical cycle as a FAIR theor:


The title is prefaced with `FAIR theory`:

```
# FAIR theory: The Empirical Cycle
```

The description gives further information about the theory and its scope:

```
## Description

This is a FAIR implementation of De Groot and Spiekerman's "empirical cycle" theory, a theory of cumulative knowledge acquisition through scientific research.
```

The Interoperability section tells readers how the theory is implemented, and in which ways it can be reused:

```
## Interoperability

The theory is implemented in the DOT language for describing graphs.

### Rendering the theory using graphviz

See the graphviz manual for more information: https://graphviz.org

```
